===============

This project implements a simple map of University of Glasgow's Gilmorehill campus as an Android application. The sole purpose of this application is to be useful around the times when people need to look up building locations and make their way around the university. This application is published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radkokotev.glasgow.uni.map).

Current state
-------------

The application was first released in September 2012, on time for Fresher's week. Hardly any work has been done on it since then. Two small updates were made to fix minor issues and to improve usability. The application has been clean up and is ready for its new update, which aims to improve the way the list of buildings is updated. It is still the case that an application update is required in order to introduce a new entry to the application. The *upcoming* update tries to address this by decoupling the list of buildings from the core of the application.

Contributions
-------------

Contribution of any kind is accepted. Code reviews and suggestions for improvements are welcome. Contributions to new functionality, UI, design, etc is greatly appreciated. Keeping the list of buildings fresh is also important.
